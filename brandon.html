    <p>This work very much focuses on the life of Brandon Teena, a young transgender man. In 1993 he was raped and
        murdered in Nebraska when it was discovered that he was anatomically female. This project is a web project that
        uses the nature of the Internet as a means to explore Brandon’s tragic story. It used hyperlinked images of a
        disembodied human form, once-live chat rooms on the subject of crime and punishment, and graphic moving images
        in order to illuminate the wide-reaching effect of Brandon’s life and death. This was presented in the
        Guggenheim Museum and was its first official engagement with the then-emerging medium of Internet art and one of
        the first works of this medium commissioned by a major institution. The cultural impact was to spread
        information about visibility and issues facing the transgender community.
