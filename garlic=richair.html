    <p>“Shu Lea Cheang’s Garlic=Rich Air was an interactive online project and participatory artwork that imagined a
        post-capitalist society in the year 2030 in which community wireless would be the only internet and organic
        garlic the primary currency.” In the project, users would sign up for the economy through a website where they
        would trade digital goods for organic garlic. The value was decided by the community. Following a period of
        trading, Cheang created a virtual-to-physical exchange where virtual garlic could be traded for real bulbs. This
        exchange was staged as a street performance based around a pick-up truck adorned with the slogan “GET GARLIC. GO
        WIRELESS.” Fitted with free wireless connectivity and carrying hundreds of pounds of freshly harvested garlic,
        the truck facilitated a lively barter-based micro-economy on the streets of New York in a “real-time fictional
        scenario” that prototyped strategies for community adaptation and exchange in the face of climate change and
        economic precarity. The cultural impact was about how the internet and societal interaction interact with each
        other in a fun and almost silly way. It was created during the continuing rise of net art.
